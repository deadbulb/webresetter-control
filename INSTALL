Sorry, only some hints for installing it at
the moment.

Just figure out how it works and configure
it for yourself.

Installation Hints
==================

worker
======

The worker is supposed to run 
always as daemon. Since PHP is
not really designed for daemons
in general the worker exits after
about 1 day and should be restar-
ted directly after exit.

I suggest DJBs daemon tools for 
keeping it running or any other
service management tool.
