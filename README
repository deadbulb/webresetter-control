=======================

There is ...

- a worker process, that process requests for
  checks and hw-resets of connected servers

  by mac-address, servername, or directly 
  by Webresetter-ID

- a webinterface, that shows a list of servers

  by click on a web page

  all configured webresetters

- a plugin for check_mk to integrate the webresetters
  into check_mk monitoring

** MISSING **

At the moment the code to control the webresetter
Hub is not included because this is proprietary
Software, which must not be published. It has to
be rewritten in order to make this package
functional.

If you are able to write it for your self you
may do this by using the Reference manual on
the ICO website. --> www.webresetter.com
