webresetter-control
===================

Purpose:

This is a collection of scripts, which are checking 
and resetting servers connected via Telejet Webresetter.

Functionality in Detail
=======================

There is ...

- a worker process, that process requests for
  checks and hw-resets of connected servers

- a command line Scripts that resets server
  by mac-address, servername, or directly 
  by Webresetter-ID

- a webinterface, that shows a list of servers
  from a config file to directly reboot servers
  by click on a web page

- a job creator, which creates check-jobs for 
  all configured webresetters

- a plugin for check_mk to integrate the webresetters
  into check_mk monitoring

** MISSING **

At the moment the code to control the webresetter
Hub is not included because this is proprietary
Software, which must not be published. It has to
be rewritten in order to make this package
functional.
